==== THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE - USE AT YOUR OWN RISKS ====

oblivious is essentially a file based content management system with a focus on encryption, security and privacy.


oblivious began while trying to further modularize a fork of the anonymous pastebin called ZeroBin; 


The oblivious system itself is built in a very simple, easy to understand way. When you create a new entry, all you are doing is creating a file (following a particular folder/naming structure); The contents of the file will be the contents of your entry (but encrypted with a server key); This entry can have certain attributes like expiration time, burnafterreading, and open-discussions(comments). If you are the creator of an entry, you will get a special 'delete token' that let's you remove the entry before its expiration date. 

oblivious also provides a mechanism to 'invite' users into entries, allows users to comment on entries, add images to content or comments, password protect specific content, and even specify expiration times. This feature-set is sure to expand in the future.

The oblivious system is built on the Slim framework - a microframework for PHP.

=== ORIGINS ===

oblivious has its origins in ZeroBin - a minimalist, opensource online pastebin where the server 
has zero knowledge of pasted data.
